# Full Stack JavaScript React Template

One of the hardest part about building Full Stack is the initial setup. There aren't too many guides out there that had project set ups that I liked. and most React tutorials recommend using the Create-React-App command to quickly get started. This is great for small React projects or just testing out React. But I find this approach a little inflexible. Especially if you want to group the Front End and the Back End in one repository.

This template is my solution. This project is set up with a simple webpack config with loaders already added for fonts, jsx, css, images. For additional loaders please see webpack documentation. I've also set up webpack to proxy api calls to the server. This set up works well for small to medium sized projects. For any large projects it may be better to split the front end and back end into separate repos completely.
